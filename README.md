A component driven answer to inclusivity and usabillity of accesabillity.

Endeavour Design is a UI component library focused to bringing refined experiences to visually impaired users, while maintaining endless styling possibilities.

> ⚠️ This project is made for my bachelor thesis and is not production ready or maintained actively.

## Made for all
The components are styled pretty basicly, but are usable out-of-the-box nonetheless. Every style can be overwritten to match you own style-guide. Check the components' specific documentation to see what can be styled, or check it's [live demo]().

To make sure Endeavour's components can be used in your project, we've made the component using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/). The components are easy to read, object based Web Components compatible with every framework or none at all.

## Learning tool
Endeavour Design is focused on development of developers. While developing and testing the components with screen reader users, we often gain new insights about accessibility. The documentation is a centered place where we share these insights and share our knowledge. This way, we try to improve our stake on the accessibilty of the web we create.

## Contribute
Read upon [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/html/get-started/introduction) before starting ate this project.

Check the [docs](./CONTRIBUTING.MD) for details about component configuration.
